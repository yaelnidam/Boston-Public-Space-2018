                            As the crown jewel and most prominent of public parks in Boston due to its central position on the Freedom Trail, the  <strong> Boston Common & Public Garden  </strong> is technically two separate parks. The Boston Common is the oldest public park in the United States, founded in 1634, and is 50 acres in size. The Boston Public Garden, founded in 1837, is separated from the Common by Charles Street and is 24 acres in size. The Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway is a relatively new park as it was developed following the relocation of the highway under the Boston during the Big Dig. It was completed in 2008 and the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway Conservancy maintains its 17 acres. Its shape follows the contours of the underground highway from North End to Chinatown and South Station.  Alongside the RFK Greenway in Boston is the Boston Aquarium and Long Wharf, which consists of two historic wharfs and a public access harborwalk.

                          At the core of the downtown Boston, these parks are surrounded by extremely wealthy neighborhoods including Beacon Hill, South End, and the Financial District. The 2015 5-Year ACS median income for these areas ranges from $53,136-$71,738 in North End to $100,000-$176,000 along the Waterfront and Aquarium, and $71,738-$100,000 in Back Bay. Directly to the south of the Common is Chinatown, a much less wealthy neighborhood with a median income of $10,446-$30,000. The Chinatown neighborhood directly to the south of the Common, Beacon Hill and Back Bay to the north and west of the Common, and the North End neighborhood at the Northern end of the RFK Greenway are among the densest in Boston with between 101-1628 residents per acre <a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/6d0e3066-e00f-4cee-8ec3-1fe7b561ffec/ ">(source: Boston Planning & development agency)</a>.

                <h2>Walking Tour of Downtown Boston</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                  Starting at South Station, anyone who visits Boston is in for a treat as they explore the waterfront, RFK Greenway, and Boston Common. Some of this route is a part of the historic <a href="https://www.thefreedomtrail.org/"> Freedom Trail</a>. From South Station you move along the RFK Greenway towards the Aquarium. As you move along this route, you will notice temperatures will range from 80-85F and flooding will begin as the elevation lowers once you near the Boston Harbor Hotel and Harbor Towers. The deepest parts of the floodwaters and lowest temperatures occur while on Long Wharf next to the New England Aquarium. From here, temperatures begin to rise and floodwaters disappear as you move towards the North End along the Greenway. The temperatures will dip suddenly as you enter the canyons of the Financial District, towered over by skyscrapers. These temperatures warm quickly as you move towards the Common. Once you cross Tremont Street, everything cools. This is due to the wide open green spaces, water features, and shaded nature of the Common and Public Garden. These temperatures rise again once you leave the Public Garden headed for Newbury Street.

                  <p class="lead">
                      Significant cooling patterns emerge around Boston Common, RFK Greenway, and the Wharfs. Near the Common and Public Garden, the southern parts of the park and margins remain cooler than the northern, likely due to shading from the tall buildings in the Chinatown and Financial District areas. This same cooling occurs along the entirety of the Greenway (except in the North End) and the Wharf/Aquarium. Whether some of this cooling is due to the presence of the park or the tall buildings and adjacent ocean, is undetermined. Nevertheless, the entire Wharf and Aquarium area remain much cooler than the more inland and north neighborhoods. This cooling effect is between 7-10Â° Celsius cooler than the warmest points in Beacon Hill, the West End, and the North End.

                    Downtown Boston's waterfront parts of Boston will experience significant flooding due to storm events. This flooding will completely cover significant portions of the RFK Greenway and the entirety of the Wharfs and Aquarium. Boston Common and Public Garden will remain above water.
